## How it works

The extension monitors Amazon checkout pages and shows a thoughtful intervention modal when you're about to make a purchase. It provides time-aware messaging and offers alternatives like visiting the BuyNothing practice store.

## Features

- **Smart timing-based messages**: Different prompts for late night, morning, afternoon, and evening shopping
- **Non-judgmental intervention prompts**: Supportive messaging that doesn't shame
- **Direct link to BuyNothing practice store**: Easy redirect to guilt-free shopping
- **Cart total display**: Shows the amount you're about to spend
- **Simple, clean interface**: Minimal, thoughtful design
- **No tracking or data collection**: Your privacy is protected

## Supported Sites

- Amazon.com (all checkout and cart pages)
- Triggers on: checkout pages, cart pages, and "Buy Now" buttons

## Time-Based Messaging Examples

**Late Night (10PM - 5AM):**
- "It's 2AM and you're about to spend $47.99. Tomorrow you might feel different about this purchase. What if you slept on it?"

**Morning (6AM - 11AM):**
- "Starting your day with a $47.99 purchase? What if you channeled this energy into something that actually fills you up?"

**Afternoon (12PM - 5PM):**
- "Midday shopping therapy? This $47.99 won't solve what's really bothering you. What would actually help right now?"

**Evening (6PM - 9PM):**
- "End of day shopping? This $47.99 might temporarily distract from stress, but it won't solve it. What would actually help you unwind?"
